collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-censoredplanet-covid
excerpt: 'After the unprecedented arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Internet has become a crucial source of essential information on the virus. To prevent the spread of misinformation and panic, many authorities have resorted to exercising higher control over Internet resources. Although there is anecdotal evidence that websites containing information about the pandemic are blocked in specific countries, the global extent of these censorship efforts is unknown. In this work, we perform the first global censorship measurement study of websites obtained from search engine queries on COVID-19 information in more than 180 countries.'
