I'm a Computer Science Ph.D student working with [Rahul Chatterjee](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~chatterjee/) in the [MadS&P Research Group](https://madsp.cs.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/).
I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the Univeristy of Michigan-Ann Arbor.

I am building usable security systems and researching the security needs of vulnerable populations, focusing on the survivors of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV).

If you want to reach out to me, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:ceccio@wisc.edu).
